# YNOEngine build scripts

This directory contains build scripts to allow for building YNOEngine in Docker.

1. If you didn't run `scripts/init.sh` in the main ynodeploy directory, run `./prepare.sh` to download the repositories and apply buildscript patches.
2. Run `./build.sh` to build the engine.
